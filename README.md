This project requires Flask - a back-end framework for creating web applications. Using pip, run:

```
pip install flask
```

Make sure to have flask configured to:
 - Target the file `app.py`
 - Media/static folder set to `static`
 - Templates folder set to `templates`
   
Then, download this repository. Run the file `setup.py` to initialize the sqlite3 database. Then, run `app.py`. You will see a localhost IP pop up in the terminal. Press the link to open the application in your browser.

If you encounter an internal server error, clear the `database.db` file and run `setup.py` again.
